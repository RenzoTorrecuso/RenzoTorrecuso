Hi, thanks for passing by.

I am thrilled to live in this time in history where we can associate robust mathematical tools to high computation power and build models which surpass our sensorial limitations in perceiving reality.   
In the past 12 years I have been analyzing our reality decoder, the brain, using EEG, tas and resting state fMRI.
Aimgin to go further in the pursuit of understanding complex problems I have been building predictive models also with datasets from other complex areas like promoting internet traffic for a website, financial inclusion, real state eda,sentiment analysis from written reports and psychodelic intake.  

## My current Projects
- **Project 1**:d-drivers.
- **Project 2**: Financial Inclusion in Africa.
- **Project 3**: Real State Exploratory Data Analysis.
